Andrew Arnott forked this project from http://openidmembership.codeplex.com/
At CodePlex, the project was created years ago and not touched ever since. 
It was using a very old version of Janrain.OpenId.dll (an ancient predecessor
to DotNetOpenAuth) and had severe security holes in several places.  I have
updated the project to use DotNetOpenAuth and fixed several security holes.
But I HAVE NOT fully reviewed or even tested it after my changes, and I
DO NOT WARRANT that this is a secure project to use in your Sharepoint sites.
I'd venture that it's better than the copy of CodePlex, but you should do
your own due diligence and review for security yourself before using it.
